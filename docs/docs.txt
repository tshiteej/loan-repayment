The project has proper git commits and logs to check the code history and its evolution throughout the development process.

Node version used: v17.9.1

Collections Created:
    1. User: To store data related to User profiles
    2. Loan: To store data related to loan with a reference to users

Tech Disclaimer:
- We are not using env variable now, so the variables are in a config file.
- We are using mongodb-memory-server as DB, for ease of use in the assignment.
- MongoDB was chosen over SQL databases, as data in this kind of use-cases might grow exponentially with time, with defined access patterns.

P.S: No LLM model(ChatGPT, Bard etc) was used in writing code/ doc of this assignment. ðŸ˜…
